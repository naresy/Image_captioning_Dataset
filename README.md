<h1>Image-Caption Dataset Creation</h1>

<p>This repository contains a project focused on creating a dataset of image-caption pairs using Python. The dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, such as image recognition or captioning.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>caption/</strong> - Directory containing caption data used in the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>images/</strong> - Directory containing the images used for generating the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>new_dataset/</strong> - Directory containing the final structured dataset of image-caption pairs.</li>
    <li><strong>.DS_Store</strong> - System file related to macOS, not relevant to the project.</li>
    <li><strong>main.py</strong> - Python script that automates the process of generating the dataset by linking images with captions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The project involves collecting images, generating captions, and compiling them into a structured dataset. This dataset is ideal for training machine learning models that need annotated image data.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the <strong>main.py</strong> script. Ensure that the images and captions are correctly placed in their respective directories before running the script.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The dataset generated can be used in various machine learning tasks, including image captioning, recognition, and other computer vision applications.</p>
